### The Story Behind This Project

In the Spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the live entertainment industry hard, and Goldstar Events —where I was working— was no exception. We stopped selling tickets for live events, and our revenue plummeted. With no clear timeline for when we could return to regular sales, we had to pivot quickly and explore new opportunities.

This is when we identified a gap in the market for streaming online events. While there had been a rise in home-produced virtual events, they were often streamed on platforms not designed for this specific use case, resulting in a subpar user experience. We saw an opportunity to provide a professional platform for event organizers—one that allowed them to sell tickets, manage marketing and customer service, and stream high-quality events, all in one place.

My role in the project was to design the **event organizer site**, where organizers could create events, manage inventories, handle ticket transactions, and stream professional-quality broadcasts.

### Doing Our Research

This project was unlike anything I had worked on before at Goldstar. The urgency of the situation meant we had to move quickly—very quickly. We spent a few days interviewing eight of our closest partners to understand their workflows for producing and selling online events, as well as their pain points and needs. Additionally, we conducted a competitive analysis of similar services offered by other companies and reused some of our existing user personas.

### Ideation

Product managers, developers, and designers came together to create an initial story map, prioritizing features for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that we needed to launch in under three months. While some decisions were driven by user research, others were based on stakeholder assumptions and our prior experience at Goldstar. We were fortunate to work with partners who helped validate many of those assumptions.

One key decision was to integrate third-party solutions to handle payments and transactions (via Stripe), as well as marketing and analytics (using Mailchimp and Toneden).

With this groundwork in place, I started sketching wireframes and flows for the main sections of the organizer site.

### Testing and Release

I created mockups and prototypes, which we tested with our launch partners. We quickly iterated from these initial prototypes to a working version and then moved into beta. We were able to do a soft launch in June, and after that we kept iterating and improving the platform.

Seven of the eight initial partners migrated to our platform, and in the following months, **more than 300 new partners started streaming their shows on Stellar**.

### Key Takeaways

The pandemic forced us to operate like a startup: roles were fluid, and everyone had a voice in the development process. This wasn’t a problem—it made collaboration easier and more effective. Looking back after eight months, I can confidently say that this fast-paced, collaborative approach laid the foundation for a solid product that will be a key part of Goldstar's future.
