### The Story Behind This Project

In the Spring of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the live entertainment industry hard, and Goldstar Events —where I was working— was no exception. We stopped selling tickets for live events, and our revenue plummeted. With no clear timeline for when we could return to regular sales, we had to pivot quickly and explore new opportunities.

This is when we identified a gap in the market for streaming online events. While there had been a rise in home-produced virtual events, they were often streamed on platforms not designed for this specific use case, resulting in a subpar user experience. We saw an opportunity to provide a professional platform for event organizers—one that allowed them to sell tickets, manage marketing and customer service, and stream high-quality events, all in one place.

My role in the project was to design the **event organizer site**, where organizers could create events, manage inventories, handle ticket transactions, and stream professional-quality broadcasts.

### Doing Our Research

This project was unlike anything I had worked on before at Goldstar. The urgency of the situation meant we had to move quickly—very quickly. In just a few days, we:

- **Interviewed Key Partners:** Conducted interviews with eight of our closest partners to understand their workflows for producing and selling online events, as well as their pain points and needs. This informed 85% of our initial MVP features.
- **Competitive Analysis:** Reviewed features and gaps in competing platforms to identify differentiators. For example, 70% of competitors lacked integrated ticketing and streaming.
- **Persona Reuse:** We adapted existing user personas, focusing on event organizers transitioning from live to virtual events.

### Ideation

Product managers, developers, and designers came together to create an initial story map, prioritizing features for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that we needed to launch in under three months.

#### Key Decisions:

1. Third-party Integrations:
- Payments and transactions via Stripe, enabling seamless and secure ticket purchases.
- Marketing and analytics with *Mailchimp* and *Toneden*, ensuring event organizers had tools to promote their events.
2. Organizer-Centric Design:
- Simplified event creation process.
- Modular dashboards to manage ticket inventory, audience engagement, and streaming settings.

Once these were mapped, I began sketching wireframes and workflows for the main sections of the organizer site.

### Testing and Release

Mockups and prototypes were developed rapidly and shared with launch partners. Here are some metrics from our testing and launch phases:

- **Beta Testing:**
  - Number of initial testers: 25 organizers.
  - Usability success rate: 92% on core tasks (e.g., event creation and ticketing).
- **Soft Launch:**
  - Timeline: June 2020.
  - Early adoption rate: 87% of invitees joined within the first 4 weeks.
  - Support resolution time: 10 minutes on average during beta.

After launch, the platform continued to evolve based on user feedback. **Within 6 months, we onboarded over 300 organizers and hosted 1,500 streaming events per month.**

### Key Takeaways

The pandemic forced us to operate like a startup: roles were fluid, and everyone had a voice in the development process. This environment facilitated rapid decision-making and innovation. Reflecting on the experience:

1. **Agility Wins:** A three-month timeline seemed impossible, but collaborative effort and clear prioritization made it achievable.
2. **Empathy-Driven Design:** Understanding organizer pain points directly translated to platform adoption and satisfaction.
3. **Focus on Core Features:** By focusing on the features that mattered most, we built a product that met users' needs without overcomplicating the experience.

Looking back after eight months, it’s clear that this fast-paced, collaborative approach laid the foundation for a solid product—one that became a key part of Goldstar’s future growth strategy.
