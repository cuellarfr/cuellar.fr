### A Quick Overview

- **Goal:** Introduce an interactive seat selection experience for premium ticket offerings.
- **My Role:** Conduct user and stakeholder research, develop proto-personas, lead competitive analysis, and design iterative prototypes leading to the final solution.
- **Approach:** Agile, iterative design with extensive usability testing.

### The Story Behind This Project

Since its founding in 2002, **Goldstar Events** has been a leader in selling discounted tickets for live entertainment. A unique feature of the Goldstar experience is its algorithm that automatically selects the best seats available at checkout based on a chosen price range.

However, by 2016, market expectations had shifted. Competitors were providing customers the ability to choose their seats via interactive seating charts, a feature premium ticket buyers increasingly expected. In response, Goldstar embarked on an ambitious journey to develop a new seating selection technology from scratch. The ultimate goal? To offer a seamless, engaging, and intuitive way for users to pick their seats while maintaining Goldstar’s hallmark customer-centric experience.

My role in this project involved laying the groundwork for the feature, conducting research, designing prototypes, and collaborating across teams to refine and implement the solution.

### Research & Discovery

#### Defining Business Requirements
The first step in the process was understanding stakeholder needs. I conducted a series of interviews with internal stakeholders to define key business requirements, including:

- Providing a premium experience to expand Goldstar’s product offerings.
- Streamlining the seat selection process to ensure speed and simplicity.
- Supporting Goldstar’s existing dynamic pricing model.

From these discussions, I developed two **proto-personas** representing typical customers:

1. The Casual Buyer: Seeks simplicity and convenience over granular control.
2. The Power User: Demands control over seat selection for an optimized viewing experience.

#### Competitive Analysis
To benchmark Goldstar against the industry, I analyzed eight competing ticketing companies with existing interactive seating chart solutions. For each competitor, I evaluated:

- Key design strengths and weaknesses.
- Usability of their interactive charts.
- Mobile and desktop experiences.
- Technical feasibility for adaptation in Goldstar’s platform.

#### Key Findings:

- Simplicity and speed were critical. Overloading users with options often led to choice paralysis.
- Visual clarity in displaying available, unavailable, and selected seats was essential.
- Mobile responsiveness was lacking in many solutions, leaving a gap we could address.

### Ideation & Iterative Prototyping

With a foundation of insights, I moved into the design phase:

1. **Low-Fidelity Prototyping:**
I sketched and wireframed three initial prototypes focused on clarity, ease of navigation, and mobile-friendliness. These prototypes included basic seat selection flows and various visual treatments for seat availability.

2. **Early Usability Testing:**
These prototypes were casually tested with coworkers for initial feedback and then tested with a small group of customers. The feedback informed areas of improvement, including the need for better grouping of seats and clearer legends.

3. **Iterative Design Process:**
Over the next several months, I iterated through **10 prototypes**, refining features based on multiple rounds of **usability testing** with diverse customer segments. Key adjustments included:
  - Enhancing seat clarity and size for mobile users.
  - Adding hover and tooltip interactions to display additional seat details (e.g., price and view).
  - Introducing a zoom feature for larger venues.

### Challenges & Solutions

#### Technical Constraints
Some of the envisioned features, such as real-time seat availability updates, were technically infeasible for initial implementation. To address this, I collaborated closely with engineers to design temporary solutions that could scale over time.

#### Balancing Simplicity and Control
Our primary user base preferred simplicity, but power users demanded more granular controls. We resolved this by creating a dual-tier interface:

- A streamlined default view for casual buyers.
- Advanced filters and sorting options for power users.

#### Stakeholder Alignment
Different teams often had competing priorities, ranging from marketing concerns to technical limitations. Clear communication and regular workshops helped align everyone on user-first principles.

### Implementation

After finalizing the prototype, I worked with developers to implement the solution incrementally:

1. **Limited Release:**
The feature launched on a limited number of events, allowing us to monitor usage patterns and collect real-world feedback.

2. **Feedback Integration:**
Over six months, data gathered from user interactions and surveys helped us refine the design. Notable improvements included better performance optimization for mobile and clearer seating legends.

3. **Full Rollout:**
The fully developed solution was integrated into all applicable premium ticket listings.

### Key Metrics & Results

- **Customer Feedback**
  - Usability satisfaction score post-launch: 4.6/5.
  - 83% of surveyed users found seat selection “intuitive and efficient.”
- **Engagement**
  - Feature adoption rate in the first six months: 78% for premium tickets.
  - Mobile usage increased by 35%, owing to the responsive design of the seating chart.
- **Business Impact**
  - Conversion rates for premium tickets rose by 15%.
  - Revenue from premium tickets increased by 20% within six months of the full rollout.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Start with the User:** By involving customers early and often, we created a feature that resonated with their needs.
2. **Embrace Constraints:** Technical limitations forced us to innovate with temporary solutions that still delivered value.
3. **Iterate Quickly:** Rapid prototyping and testing enabled us to refine the experience efficiently.
4. **Collaboration is Key:** Strong partnerships with engineers and stakeholders ensured the feature’s success.

By blending user insights with iterative design and development, we successfully introduced a premium ticketing feature that elevated the Goldstar experience while driving measurable business results.
