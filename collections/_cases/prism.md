## The Story Behind this Project

In 2023, Trimble started working on a next-generation ERP platform to replace their aging existing software. The plan was to build a single accounting engine using modern technology, with different front-end layers targeting different markets. This approach would let Trimble sell various solutions while sharing the same core platform.

The company initially focused on designing for mid-size companies, but **in September 2024 we pivoted to target SMB contractors** instead - specifically owners and operators of small construction companies with 1-5 employees and yearly revenue under $10 million.

I am the Lead UX Designer on this project, responsible for defining the user experience strategy, and leading the design process. I manage a international team of four designers and one researcher.

## User Research

### The Challenge

Trimble had no previous experience working with this market. We needed to understand how small construction business owners manage their finances, run their operations, and use technology in their daily work.

### Discovery Process

We partnered with an external agency to conduct discovery research with 35 people through in-depth, 60-minute interviews. The research was segmented by company revenue and explored the digitization journey of small construction businesses - how they form, operate, and expand.

### Key Outputs

The research was synthesized into two user personas that captured the needs, behaviors, and pain points of our target users. These personas guided the design process and informed the development of the product. They also helped us identify the most common challenges faced by small construction businesses and the opportunities for improvement.

## Defining a UX Vision

Based on the research findings and discussions with the product team and stakeholders, we developed a vision for the project built on four core principles:

- **Simplified UI**: A targeted interface for SMB users that reduces accounting complexity and matches their mental model through wizards, guided workflows, and approachable language.
- **Flexible architecture**: A single financial logic engine independent from the UI to serve multiple personas.
- **Mobile-first design**: Responsive approach scaling from mobile to desktop to serve both field and office needs.
- **Growth-oriented**: Persona-based design offering competitive value with a seamless upgrade path.

We presented a high-level flow map and prototype with our initial ideas, which were validated by C-level executives.

## Design Process

### A New Design System

Trimble's existing design system felt outdated and too corporate for our SMB audience. My team created a visual refresh that eventually became the foundation for a new company-wide design system. This wasn’t just about aesthetics - it was about creating an approachable, trustworthy interface that would resonate with busy construction professionals. We also incorporated a set of illustrations that brought personality and warmth to the application.

### Information Architecture

Collaborating closely with product management, we refined the app’s information architecture around a hub-and-dashboard concept:

- **Financial insight dashboards** providing at-a-glance business health metrics
- **Project management hubs** for organizing work and tracking progress
- **Wizard-driven workflows** for entering financial data without accounting expertise

### Collaborative Ideation and Validation

For each functional area, we established this process:

1. **Requirements Gathering**: Product provided user stories and initial requirements, followed by collaborative refinement sessions
2. **Design Exploration**: UX created user flows and initial design concepts, iterating with product feedback
3. **User Validation**: Prototypes were tested with real users through our research team’s usability testing program
4. **Design Refinement**: Research recommendations were incorporated and designs were validated by stakeholders

This process ensured our solutions were both technically feasible and user-centered.

## Key Design Solutions

### Dashboard

The dashboard serves as the command center for small construction businesses, translating complex financial data into actionable insights. Key features include:

- Visual project profitability indicators
- Cash flow projections
- Outstanding invoices and payments due
- Quick access to common tasks

### Job Creation Wizard

The “Add a Job” wizard exemplifies our approach to simplifying complex processes:

- Progressive disclosure of information
- Smart defaults based on previous entries
- Visual progress indicators
- Plain-language explanations of financial concepts

These workflows transform intimidating accounting tasks into manageable, guided experiences.

## Key Learnings

### Research-Driven Pivot Success

The strategic pivot from mid-market to SMB required completely reimagining our approach. This experience reinforced the critical importance of user research in guiding product strategy, not just informing design details.

### Design System Impact

What began as a visual refresh for one product became a catalyst for organizational change. This demonstrates how thoughtful design work can have impact beyond individual projects.

### Constraint-Driven Innovation

Technical and timeline constraints, rather than limiting creativity, often sparked more innovative solutions. Working closely with engineering teams led to designs that were both user-friendly and technically elegant.

## Reflection

Leading this project reinforced the importance of user research in driving product strategy and the value of close collaboration across disciplines. While we're still pre-launch, the work has already influenced Trimble's design standards and approach to serving underserved markets.

The experience of managing an international team through a major strategic pivot while establishing new design standards has been both challenging and educational, highlighting the intersection of user needs, business goals, and technical constraints in successful product design.
