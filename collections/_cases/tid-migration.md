### The story behind this project

Trimble Construction One is a suite of software solutions for construction companies that includes two well-established ERPs: Spectrum and Vista. These two applications have slightly different capabilities and they target different markets, but they had one thing in common: an outdated log in system. In order to comply with internal security requirements and provide a unified UX across other Trimble products, the company decided to start using a new authentication system called Trimble ID. This project provided a migration path for all the users of Spectrum and Vista.
