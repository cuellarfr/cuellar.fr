### The story behind this project

Trimble Construction One is a suite of software solutions for construction companies that includes two well-established ERPs: Spectrum and Vista. These two applications have slightly different capabilities and they target different markets, but in 2022 they had one thing in common: outdated login systems. In order to comply with internal security requirements and provide a unified UX across other Trimble products, the company decided to start using a new authentication system called Trimble ID (TID). This project provided a migration path for all the users of Spectrum and Vista.

One thing that is common in software that has been around for decades is that you find a lot of baggage, different technologies implemented over time that make the planning of a project like this more complicated, with a lot of different scenarios to cover. We found out that 92% of the ERP users were still logging in using a legacy system that we called ERPID. Then we had 8% using a more modern system called Viewpoint ID (VPID). Some of those VPID users also had a federated AAD (Microsoft) login, and some others had 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled. And they all required different migration strategies.

We decided that the first phase of the migration would only affect the VPID users (around 60,000). This was a number that we all felt comfortable with. Our goal was to have a seamless migration for all of these users, but if something went wrong we didn't want to overwhelm our customer service department. Months later, with all the lessons learnt from this first phase, we would start a second phase with the ERPID users. Technically, they needed to be migrated first to VPID, and then to TID, but this ended up being a complexity that was hidden to the users.

### Mapping all scenarios

UX and Product worked closely on mapping everything that could happen before, during and after the migration
