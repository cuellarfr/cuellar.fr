Hard to believe, but it's been 9 years since I wrote a post about the things I use for work, so I think it's time for an update. I also recently saw this is becoming a trend in personal websites, so let's do it.

### Hardware

- [16" Macbook Pro, 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 16 Gb (2019)](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.6-six-core-16-2019-scissor-specs.html).
This is my work laptop and, for security reasons, it's the only device I use for work. It's slightly outdated but I think I'll be getting an M2 Pro model soon.
- [Mac mini M1 (2020)](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP823?locale=en_US).
My personal computer, the one I use for all my private projects. It's the first entry model Apple released with the new Apple Silicon chips, and it's inexpensive but great. It's a super basic model but I might keep it for another year or two.
- [Mac mini 2.5 Ghz Intel Core i5 8 Gb (2012)](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_mini/specs/mac-mini-core-i5-2.5-late-2012-specs.html).
A headless Mac mini I use as a home server. The main use is file sharing, but it's also a [Plex](https://www.plex.com/) server and it runs some home automation software ([Homebridge](https://homebridge.io/) and [Scrypted](https://www.scrypted.app/)). 
- [34" Ultrawide Gigabyte M34WQ display](https://www.gigabyte.com/Monitor/M34WQ#kf).
I started using ultrawide displays a few years ago and, once you get used to them, it's hard to go back to a regular 16:9 screen. This model has a built-in KVM switch that allows me to easily share mouse and keyboard with all my computers. The only thing that would make this display perfect is 4k resolution, that's something that will be a must in my next display.
- [Logitech Craft keyboard and MX Master 2S mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/mx/master-series.html).
I'm a big fan of Logitech peripherals and the MX line is so nice to use. One caveat: I recommend using [BetterMouse](https://better-mouse.com/) to customize the settings since Logitech's software is pretty heavy and bloated.
- [Sony MDR-V6 headphones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_MDR-V6).
The classic studio headphones from Sony. Natural sound and pretty much indestructible.
- [Amazon Basics condenser microphone](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Desktop-Mini-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B076ZSR6BB).
Sometimes it's hard to find in stock, but it's a great little microphone for $30.
- [Ikea Markus Chair](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/markus-office-chair-vissle-dark-gray-90289172/).
It's not as nice as the Herman Miller chair I used before, but for $200 it's pretty great. Not super customizable, but it works just fine for tall people like me.
- [Husky solid wood workbench](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-62-in-W-x-24-in-D-Adjustable-Height-Solid-Wood-Top-Workbench-Table-in-Black-HOLT62XDB12/301810799).
A Home Depot purchase, I use this workbench as my desk because is really solid and the height is (manually) adjustable. Super happy with this purchase too.

### Software

- My main design tool is [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), but I also use [Acorn](https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/) for bitmap editing, [Miro](https://miro.com/) for quick diagrams and [Maze](https://maze.co/) for research and usability testing.
- My main productivity app is [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/). More than just an outliner, I use it for notetaking, project planning, bookmarks, habit tracking and more.
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is still my app launcher of choice. I have many customized workflows and I don't see myself moving to another launcher anytime soon.
- And [Plexamp](https://www.plex.tv/plexamp/) has been my favorite music player for a while. If you still have a local music library, it's really a no brainer.
