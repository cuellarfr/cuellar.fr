![My new office](/assets/images/office-shed.jpg)

Super excited about my new home office. With two little ones running around the house, the "laundry room turned office" solution I used during the pandemic wasn't working anymore, so my SO and I decided to install a shed in the backyard and I couldn't be happier with the final result. There's wired internet, plenty of light and, more importantly, silence and peace!
