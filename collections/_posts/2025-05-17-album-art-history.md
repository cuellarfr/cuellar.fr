[Matt Str√∂m-Awn](https://matthewstrom.com/) writes about the evolution of album cover design, from the utilitarian beginnings to the emergense as a vital form of artistic and cultural expression. Fun fact: after all these years collecting records, I have to admit that I didn't know the origin of the term "record album" until I read Matt's post.
