A few months ago I got a message on LinkedIn. It wasn't the classic "I applied to a job in your company, please recommend me", this was a TV producer from Spain asking if I'd be interested in being on a travel TV show. In this show, the host travels around the world and they ask Spaniards living abroad to show the city where they live. So, fast-forward until yesterday, and there I was, driving around Mount Hood and the Columbia Gorge, talking to a TV crew about Portland and being goofy in general. 

Possibly one of the most embarrassing things I've done in my entire life, but still a lot of fun.
