description: I've been using Last.fm for 20 years. Yes, I'm that old.

I started using [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/txarly) exactly 20 years ago. This means two things:
1. My Last.fm account is a precise digital record of my musical taste evolution
2. I'm officially ancient in internet years

## The Cold, Hard Stats
* Total scrobbles: 212,450 songs
* Artists listened to: 4,785
* Most active year: 2024 (apparently I'm peaking late)
* Least active years: Several complete gaps in my listening history (life happened)
* 2024 trend: Listened to 46 tracks with "fire" in the title (midlife crisis? You decide)
* Most played album: "The Smile Sessions" by The Beach Boys
* Most played track: "Thirteen" by Big Star

## What This Data Proves
1. I've spent approximately 14,333 hours of my life listening to music (that's 597 days or 1.64 years)
2. If I had practiced a skill instead of just listening to music during this time, I could have become world-class at almost anything
3. Despite technological revolutions, platform changes, and life upheavals, my dedication to tracking what plays in my headphones has remained weirdly consistent

My Last.fm account is older than YouTube, Twitter, and the iPhone. It has outlasted three cars and at least two career paths. Here's to another two decades of obsessively documenting my listening habits while wondering if this is a healthy use of my time!
