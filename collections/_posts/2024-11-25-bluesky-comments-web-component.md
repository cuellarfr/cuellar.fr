Here's a little experiment. I'm replacing the GitHub powered comments (that nobody ever used) with Bluesky powered comments. Here's the [code I borrowed from LoueeD](https://gist.github.com/LoueeD/b7dec10b2ea56c825cbb0b3a514720ed) to make it work. I installed it locally, changed a couple of things in the CSS and then adapted to work on my Jekyll blog. It was quite simple, let me know if you have questions about this.
