description: Some thoughts about my hybrid audio setup
---

Today I want to share my journey with a setup that bridges decades of audio technology. It's got me thinking about the trade-offs between convenience and longevity, and I'm curious if any of you have faced similar dilemmas.

## The Heart of My System: WiiM Amp Meets Vintage Vinyl

Let's start with the new kid on the block - my **WiiM Amp**. This little device has become the command center of my setup, primarily because it does so many things reasonably well:

- It handles streaming duties beautifully (mostly)
- Connects to my TV via HDMI ARC which is super convenient
- Looks slick with its minimalist design and its Mac Mini vibes

But it's not without quirks. The software occasionally acts like it had one too many cups of coffee - glitchy and unpredictable. And here's something that keeps me up at night: what happens in 5-7 years when software updates stop and streaming services change their APIs? I sometimes wonder if I should have gone with a WiiM Ultra streamer paired with a separate amplifier for better future-proofing.

One definite downside - no phono preamp built in. For my turntable, I had to add a **Schiit Mani** preamp to the chain. Not the end of the world, but another box and cable in the system.

## The Star of the Show: My Kenwood KD-550 Turntable

Now, let me introduce you to my pride and joy - a vintage **Kenwood KD-550 turntable** that puts modern "premium" turntables to shame.

I found this beauty used, and after some light maintenance (just a bit of lever grease and oiling some mechanical parts), it's performing like a champ. This thing is built like a tank - and I mean that literally. The dense, heavy plinth and solid construction create an incredibly stable platform for vinyl playback.

The direct drive motor spins with precision that would make Swiss watchmakers jealous. What amazes me most is the modular design - almost everything is user-serviceable and replaceable except perhaps the motor itself. Try finding that kind of repairability in today's disposable tech!

The timeless design doesn't hurt either. Clean lines, minimal controls, and that gorgeous platter spinning hypnotically... it's audio meditation.

Here's the kicker - a modern turntable with this level of engineering would easily cost $3,000-4,000. And if the motor holds up (these direct drives were built to last decades), I honestly can't imagine ever needing to upgrade.

## The Unexpected Heroes: Boston Acoustics MR-V60 Speakers

The final piece of my hybrid puzzle came almost by accident - a pair of **Boston Acoustics speakers** from the 90s that I basically got for free. These compact-but-surprisingly-heavy speakers were originally designed for home theater setups, but they're absolutely perfect for music in my space.

There's not much documentation about them online, which makes them feel like a hidden treasure. The mid-range detail is exceptional - voices and instruments have this presence that draws you into the music. They could use a bit more low-end punch (they were designed to pair with a subwoofer), but for everyday listening, they're fantastic.

What's wild is how something cast aside as "outdated" can sound this good. These speakers that someone practically gave away have become one of my favorite components.

## The Philosophy Behind My Hybrid Approach

This mixed setup has me thinking about audio equipment differently. The vintage gear - especially that Kenwood turntable - represents a philosophy of building things to last generations. Meanwhile, the WiiM represents our current era's focus on features, connectivity, and software.

I wonder if we'll ever return to building electronics with 30+ year lifespans, or if the software-dependent nature of modern audio means we're locked into upgrade cycles forever.

What's your experience mixing old and new audio gear? Have you found the perfect balance between vintage sound and modern convenience? Drop your thoughts in the comments - I'd love to hear about your hybrid setups!
