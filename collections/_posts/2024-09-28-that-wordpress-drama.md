description: The Verge on that messy WordPress drama
---

Back in the day, almost in a different lifetime, I built websites for small businesses in my little agency in Spain. And we used [WordPress](https://wordpress.org), not because it was my favorite CMS (I liked [TextPattern](https://textpattern.com) better) but because of the huge plugin ecosystem. With time, WordPress basically became Internet infrastructure, powering 43% of all websites active today. That's a lot, and this whole drama suggests that one of the founders, Matt Mullenweg, wished he would have used a different (and more lucrative) type of license. The rest is just about egos and putting your own interests before WordPress users, which is sad, but it's not the first time I see this in the open-source community.
