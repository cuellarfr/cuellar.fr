I moved to a new place, by myself, 3 weeks ago. It's a relatively small but cozy apartment (my daughter calls it 'compartment'), modern, convenient. It also lacks personality and it already feels like a temporary home where I don't want to spend more time than what's strictly necessary. But I don't have another home. Not yet. And I'm learning to embrace all the unknowns in my life. Because that's what life is about, right? Not knowing exactly what comes next.
