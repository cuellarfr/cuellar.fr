I just closed my Twitter account and I'm alright, thanks for asking. I didn't post very often, but I did follow some friends and journalists there so that made me a semi-active user, I guess. 

After Twitter, I'm not sure what's next. I have a [Mastodon account](https://social.vivaldi.net/@cuellarfr) that I've been using for a while, but Mastodon feels very... Linux (sorry, Linux users!). I love the decentralized concept and I'm excited about ActivityPub, but I can't imagine how regular folks could migrate and stay there. The onboarding experience is too rough, and there are other things like searching, or following users from other instances, that are just too hard for a non-geek user. 

Maybe they'll fix all those issues and Mastodon will become the next big thing. Or maybe it will be something else. Or maybe (and I think there's a big chance for this to happen) there won't be another big text-based social network. We'll see.
