This is the opening track of [Jonathan Wilson](https://www.songsofjonathanwilson.com)'s album [Eat the Worm](https://jonathanwilson.lnk.to/EatTheWormWE), one of my favorites of 2023 and a recommendation of my good friend Eduard. The music video I'm sharing is amazing and it was created by Andrea Nakhla using AI stable diffusion.
