Some personal news. After more than six years working at [Goldstar Events](https://www.goldstar.com/), last October I joined [Trimble](https://www.trimble.com/). Goldstar was home but I felt it was time to try new things. Trimble is an international company specialized in products (hardware and software) used in Construction, Civil Engineering, Transportation, Agriculture, Geospatial, and other industries.  

I'm working at the construction division, helping companies manage projects and human resources. This is a new industry for me and a challenge, and I'm also excited to be part of a big and diverse design team with a lot of talent. My goal is to keep learning and growing as a designer, and I'm happy to say that I think I found the perfect place for that.
