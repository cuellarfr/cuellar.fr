[The Verge on the recently discontinued TinyLetter newsletter service.](https://www.theverge.com/24085737/tinyletter-mailchimp-shut-down-email-newsletters) I remember playing with it years ago and, while I liked the minimalism, I never found a good use for it. The truth is that... I hate newsletters. My email inbox is already a hot mess, why would I want to add more clutter to it? If you want me to read your content, please give me an RSS feed, don't force me to subscribe to another email list.
