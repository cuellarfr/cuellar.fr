First real mix with tracks from Destroyer, Ladytron, Caroline Polachek, Avalanches and more. It turned out a little bit more electronic and 90s that I wanted, but I hope you still enjoy it. Also, first mix using my new dj controller and the app Mixxx (still getting familiar with both), so there might be some glitches here and there.
