description: "I'm not too fond of obvious cover songs, the ones that remain too close to the original. It's like the artist is not even trying, they are just playing somebody else's work! For this month's show, I tried to put together a playlist of covers that are the opposite: a transformation of the original art into something new and exciting. I hope you like them. Playing tracks by Oldham Brothers, M. Ward, Cowboy Junkies, Grant-Lee Phillips, The Bad Plus and more."

I'm not too fond of obvious cover songs, the ones that remain too close to the original. It's like the artist is not even trying, they are just playing somebody else's work! For this month's show, I tried to put together a playlist of covers that are the opposite: a transformation of the original art into something new and exciting. I hope you like them.
