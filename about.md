Hello, this is Carlos Cuéllar. Let me introduce myself. I'm a [certified User Experience Designer](/assets/certificates/nng-ux-certificate-cuellar.pdf) with an industrial design background and some love for all tech things. Originally from Valencia, Spain, I moved to the Portland OR area in 2014 where I live now with my wife, two kids, and an annoying chihuahua mix called Tamale (naming pets is one of my other talents).

Now, the work stuff. I've been creating digital experiences that simplify user's lives since 2006. I started working at marketing agencies in Spain, and after moving to the US in 2011 I became an in-house UX Designer specialized in B2B applications. I currently work at [Trimble Inc.](https://construction.trimble.com/en) where we craft software solutions for construction companies.

Depending on the project I might wear different hats, but I always follow a user-centered process where I collaborate closely with users, product managers, developers, and other designers.
