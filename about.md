## About me

Hi, I'm Carlos Cuéllar, a [certified User Experience Designer](/assets/certificates/nng-ux-certificate-cuellar.pdf) with an industrial design background and I have been creating experiences that simplify user's lives since 2006. Today, I work at Trimble where we craft software solutions for construction companies.

Depending on the project I might wear different hats, but I always follow a user-centered process where I collaborate closely with users, product managers, developers, and other designers. 

Originally from Valencia, Spain, I live now in the Portland area with my wife and two kids.

## About this website

This is the latest iteration of a personal website I started in the early 2000s. There are random notes about design, music, and technology, and also links to resources I find interesting. In this new version, I'm also adding links to my music podcast.

You can check the source code at this [Github](https://github.com/cuellarfr/cuellarfr.github.io) repository. The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it's hosted in [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). If you want to follow the blog, you can [subscribe to the RSS feed](/atom).
