## About me

Hi, I'm Carlos Cuellar, a certified User Experience Designer with an industrial design background and I have been creating experiences that simplify user's lives since 2006. Today, I work at Trimble where we craft software solutions for construction companies.

Depending on the project I might wear different hats, but I always follow a user-centered process where I collaborate closely with users, product managers, developers, and other designers. 

Originally from Valencia, Spain, I live now in the Portland area with my wife and two kids.

## About this website

This is the latest iteration of a personal website I started in the early 2000s. There are random notes about design, music, and technology, and also links to resources I find interesting. In this new version, I'm also adding links to my music podcast.

You can check the source code at this Github repository. The site is built using Jekyll and it's hosted in Github Pages. If you want to follow the blog, you can subscribe to the RSS feed.

Both the content and the code created by me in this website is open source. Any other external content shared here is property of their respective owners.
