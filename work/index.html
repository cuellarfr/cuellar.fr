  I am a <a href="certificates/nng-ux-certificate-cuellar.pdf"><strong>certified User Experience Designer</strong></a> with an industrial design background and some love for front-end web development. I have been creating experiences that simplify usersâ€™ lives since 2006. I'm an advocate of design as a problem solving discipline and I use empathy as a primary skill.</p>
  <h2>Where I work</h2>
  <p>I started my career in Spain working for marketing agencies. In 2011, I moved to California with my wife where I started working as an in-house designer for an e-commerce startup.</p>
  <p>My second American gig was at Lightspeed Systems, where I designed e-learning software for K-12 schools. After that, I worked at Goldstar building marketing tools for live entertainment events.</p>
  <p>I'm currently a <strong>Senior UX Designer at Trimble</strong>, where I help construction companies manage projects and human resources.</p>

  <h2>How I work</h2>
  <p>Every project is different and I often wear different hats, but my fundamental approach to UX Design is consistent. It's a collaborative and iterative process where I work closely with product managers, other designers and developers in different stages. I enjoy this approach because it's effective and I'm always learning new things. These are the steps I follow in my design process.</p>

  <h3 class="h4">1. Research</h3>
  <p>As a designer, my main job is to solve problems so I need to clearly define them. In order to do that, I interview stakeholders so I can understand the product vision and constraints. That also helps me define the project goals and schedule. After that, I normally review any existing work or product, and then I do a bit of competitive analysis in order to learn how other companies solved similar problems. Later, I do field studies and user interviews so I can understand their workflows, pain points, behaviors, needs, and map out use cases and scenarios.</p>
  <h3 class="h4">2. Ideate</h3>
  <p>At this stage of the process, I start looking for solutions to the problem. I normally work with product managers on a story map and then I immediately start sketching and creating quick wireframes that I iterate so I can explore different UI solutions.</p>
  <h3 class="h4">3. Prototype</h3>
  <p>Depending on the project, these wireframes can evolve into interactive prototypes that I build using tools like <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a>, <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a>, <a href="https://framer.com/">Framer</a> or <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>.</p>
  <h3 class="h4">4. User Test</h3>
  <p>Once I have a working prototype I need to start testing and refining it. I normally start with casual testing in the office where I ask some coworkers to complete tasks in order to find the most obvious usability issues. After that, I prepare some usability testing sessions with real users or users with a profile similar to our personas. I typically prefer in-person usability testing because it allows me to interact with users and ask follow-up questions. However, this can be time-consuming so sometimes I do remote testing using services like <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">UserTesting</a>. Once I analyze and extract the test results, I use this feedback to improve the prototype and once it's done, I test it again. The process is repeated until I reach an optimal solution for both users and stakeholders.</p>
  <h3 class="h4">5. Implement</h3>
  <p>Lastly, I work with visual designers and front-end engineers during the final implementation of the solution. The result is often deployed for a few users using A/B testing. I use web analytics and user feedback in the last round of refinement of the product.</p>
