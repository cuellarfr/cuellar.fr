### The story behind this project

In order to bring logic, consistency, and structure to our designs across multiple platforms, the design team at Goldstar decided to create a design system. We didn’t want to have just a UI kit, but a system that was flexible, scalable, and able to enforce better workflows. All the elements in this system needed to have structure and meaning, and they also needed to be easily accessible not only to designers but to all of our developers. This system was also part of a bigger rebranding effort that the company started earlier in 2018.

### Steps

1. **Visual audit.**  
The first step was to do a visual audit of the current design, compiling all existing UI elements in order to find duplicities. We reviewed not only Goldstar's main consumer site but all the different apps, marketing, and internal tools used in the company.
2. **Creation of visual design language.**  
The visual design language is the core of any design system, and it includes things like colors, typography, spacers, separators, and patterns. All these elements were based on Goldstar's new corporate branding.
3. **Creation of component libraries.**  
The design team decided that we would have separate component libraries for each product and we would start by building the one for our B2B marketing platform. This product is smaller than our consumer site and it was perfect for testing the new libraries architecture, naming conventions, etc. My job was to build this first library and find the best way to put together everything using [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) and [Abstract](https://www.abstract.com/).
4. **Documentation of components.**  
We included descriptions and instructions for each component in Sketch (for designer's reference) and in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) (a React UI component explorer used by our front-end developers).

### Component architecture

The UI components of this system work like building blocks; we categorized our components in different levels and each level builds off the one that precedes it. This is an approach that borrowed heavily from [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principles. All the component library files were structured like this:
- **Primitives:** This included colors, gradients, patterns, and spacers. We considered including here text styles, but we ended up managing them separately.<br><br>

    <img src="/images/ds-3.jpg" alt="Primitives: hand drawn patterns">
    <img src="/images/ds-1.jpg" alt="Primitives: typography">
  </div>
  </figure><br>
- **Level 1 / Foundation:** The foundation level included components that could not be broken down any further. These were the very basic building blocks of our products. As such, they could not contain nested components and overrides were minimal. Some foundational components were logos and avatars.<br><br>

  <div class="carousel" data-flickity='{ "imagesLoaded": true, "percentPosition": false }'>
    <img src="/images/ds-4.jpg" alt="L1: avatars">
    <img src="/images/ds-5.jpg" alt="L1: logos">
    <img src="/images/ds-6.jpg" alt="L1: icons">
    <img src="/images/ds-19.jpg" alt="L1: icons">
  </div>
  </figure><br>
- **Level 2 / Lower-level blocks:** These were typically composed of a combination of primitives and level 1 components. Some UI elements included here were buttons and form elements.<br><br>
  <figure>
  <div class="carousel" data-flickity='{ "imagesLoaded": true, "percentPosition": false }'>
    <img src="/images/ds-7.jpg" alt="L2: alerts">
    <img src="/images/ds-8.jpg" alt="L2: buttons">
    <img src="/images/ds-9.jpg" alt="L2: forms">
    <img src="/images/ds-10.jpg" alt="L2: forms">
    <img src="/images/ds-11.jpg" alt="L2: navigation">
    <img src="/images/ds-12.jpg" alt="L2: navigation">
  </div>
  </figure><br>
- **Level 3 / Mid-level blocks:** Mid-level blocks were typically composed of a combination of primitives, level 1, and level 2 components. Modal windows, tables, and cards were all part of this level.<br><br>
  <figure>
  <div class="carousel" data-flickity='{ "imagesLoaded": true, "percentPosition": false }'>
    <img src="/images/ds-20.jpg" alt="L3: cards">
    <img src="/images/ds-21.jpg" alt="L3: cards">
    <img src="/images/ds-13.jpg" alt="L3: cards">
    <img src="/images/ds-14.jpg" alt="L3: cards">
    <img src="/images/ds-15.jpg" alt="L3: modal windows">
    <img src="/images/ds-16.jpg" alt="L3: tables">
  </div>
  </figure><br>
- **Level 4 / Full composition:** These elements were used mostly for demo purposes. They were full-screen compositions that include all other level components and primitives.

And we also had **separate text and layer styles**. We had text styles available in multiple weights, colors, and alignments. The layer styles included predefined colors, gradients, form container states, and button states. These all helped create more flexible components in Sketch.

### Naming conventions

It was important to put in place some naming conventions that reflected our component architecture. We ended up using this:

`Level / Type of component / Component name / State or Pieces`

An example would be:

`L2/nav/breadcrumbs/_pieces/link`

Keeping a consistent naming across components was also important because Sketch used these names in order to arrange them in menus and in order to display the right component overrides. Designers were able to use these overrides to customize components with different nested elements, making them a lot more powerful and flexible.

### Maintenance and updates

So once we had the first of our component libraries ready we had to create a protocol in order to add or modify these components. Designers needed to keep in mind that modifying these components in the master library would affect any design file using this library. They could easily break things!

First of all, the designer needed to decide if a new component was necessary. Is this new component going to be reused? If the answer is no, they could detach the original Sketch symbol and call it a day. But if the new variation or pattern is likely to be reused, then it could be time to create a new component.

The new component should follow some rules:
- It needs to follow our naming conventions.
- It should use nested components when it’s possible. The designer should try to organize the layers in a hierarchical way so the overrides panel in Sketch makes sense, make the layer names semantic, and remember that color and icon symbols are good helpers.
- It should be responsive so it can be resized without breaking it.

Every time a new component was created, it had to be shared with the rest of the team before being merged into the component library. We used Abstract for version control of our files and libraries and the workflow here was very similar to git: create a branch, add your new stuff, commit your changes, ask for feedback, and if the symbol gets approved then merge your branch.

### Things I learned

The most exciting part of this project was that we were not just documenting some UI components, we were creating a new workflow for an entire team. There was a lot of trial and error in the process and I found some Sketch bugs (setting resizing constraints in nested symbols is definitely tricky) but this first library was quickly adopted by the entire team and we ended up creating additional libraries for our consumer site, newsletters, and wireframes.
