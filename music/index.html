        <blockquote>What came first, the music or the misery?</blockquote>
        <p>If you know where that quote comes from, we are going to be friends! I am a huge music nerd, a record collector and a retired amateur DJ. Today, I spend my time listening to alternative rock, but my taste is quite eclectic.</p>

        <p><strong>Experiment in Terror</strong> is a new podcast where I play music and I don't talk! I don't know if that makes this a podcast or just a collection of mixes, but it's fun to put together an hour of music I like. I started this project on <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/txarly_spins" rel="me">Mixcloud</a> but I quickly realized that, for easier distribution, it's better to publish this as a regular show in <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/experiment-in-terror/id1705297692" rel="me">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/35sLR8Yz2JWLwRSNnzISvH" rel="me">Spotify</a> and the rest of podcast platforms.</p>
        <p>You can listen to <em>Experiment in Terror</em> here, and if you like it and you want to follow me, please subscribe wherever you listen to your podcasts:</p>
