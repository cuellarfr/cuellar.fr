<div class="prose mb-12">
  <p>This is the collection of vinyl records I have accumulated. I only started buying vinyl a few years ago, I have a much bigger collection of CDs.</p>
  <p>When I started doing this, I decided I would follow two rules:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Only buy the records that really matter, my personal favorites.</li>
    <li>Don't buy again the records that I already own on CD.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Am I following those rules? Absolutely not! So here's the list organized alphabetically. I'll be adding the cover art and a link to <a href="https://www.discogs.com/">Discogs</a>, but right now it's just a work in progress.</p>
