    <h1>About Carlos</h1>
  </header>
  <p><strong>I'm Carlos Cuéllar and I'm a UX Designer from Valencia, Spain.</strong> I live in Portland, OR with my wife Jill, my daughter Sofía and our little chihuahua Tamale.</p>
  <p>When not staring at a screen, <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/txarly">I listen to classic alternative rock music records</a> (yes, that means I'm getting old) and I try to find good food in downtown Portland.</p>

  <h2 class="h4">About this website</h2>
  <p>This site is a showcase of some of my work and it's also a blog where I write random notes about design, music, technology, etc. I also keep a collection of links, some of them recovered from my old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)">Delicious</a> account.</p>
  <p>The first <a href="/blog/archive">blog posts</a> are from 2004 and at that time I was using <a href="https://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> as my publishing platform. After that, I used <a href="https://textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a> for years as my CMS of choice and right now I'm using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to generate this site and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to host it. If you want to follow the blog, you can subscribe to the <a href="/atom">RSS feed</a>.</p>
  <p>All the code and markup were made on <a href="https://macromates.com">TextMate</a>, wireframes, mockups, icons and other vector graphics were created on <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Bohemian Coding's Sketch</a>, and when I needed to edit bitmap images I used <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/">Flying Meat's Acorn</a>. The typeface you're seeing is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/plex/">IBM's Plex Sans</a>.</p>
  <p>This site has been tested and is supported in modern and ancient browsers like Chrome, Safari, Opera, Internet Explorer (9+), Edge and Firefox.</p>
