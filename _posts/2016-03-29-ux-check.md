UX Check is a Chrome Extension made by [Chris Gallello](https://medium.com/@cgallello/low-cost-usability-testing-61b5f8a2a1be#.vj474peeo) that helps you identify usability issues through a heuristic evaluation ([Nielsen's 10 heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)). And why do you want a Chrome extension for this? Convenience. Just click on an element and you'll get a screenshot and a callout where you can write your notes. Once you're done, export it as a HTML or DOCX file.
