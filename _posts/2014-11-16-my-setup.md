description: A list of hardware and software tools that I use daily at work and at home.
---

<p>I wanted to talk about some tools I use so I wrote down a list that I called &#8220;Nerd Fun Tools&#8221;, but then I found this <a href="http://usesthis.com/">blog full of nerdy interviews with people talking about stuff they use</a>. I think that&#8217;s a better format than just writing a trillion nerdy posts about similar stuff, so I&#8217;m going to pretend I&#8217;m interviewing myself and I&#8217;ll talk about <strong>stuff I use</strong>.</p>

<h3>Who are you, and what do you do?</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Carlos Cu√©llar and I design e-learning products for K-12 schools at <a href="http://lightspeedsystems.com/">Lightspeed Systems</a>. I&#8217;m a Spaniard living in Portland who enjoys caffeine, live music and Formula 1 races.</p>
<h3>What hardware do you use?</h3>
<p>My laptop is a <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/sp653">2012 Macbook Pro Retina with 500Gb <span class="caps">SSD</span>, 16 gigs of <span class="caps">RAM</span> and a 2.7Ghz i7 processor</a>. It&#8217;s the best computer I&#8217;ve ever had and I think I might keep it for another year or two. When I&#8217;m at the office, I connect my laptop to a <a href="https://www.apple.com/displays/">27&quot; Thunderbolt Display</a>, a wired Apple keyboard and a trackpad. It&#8217;s a nice setup but I really want Apple to <em>retinize</em> the Thunderbolt Display.</p>

<p>I use a <a href="https://www.apple.com/airport-time-capsule/">Time Capsule</a> as a global backup solution and sometimes I use <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a> to clone my laptop&#8217;s drive in an old external hard drive. I don&#8217;t use <a href="http://www.code42.com/crashplan/">Crashplan</a> or any cloud-based backup service because I keep most of my files in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a> and <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a>. Hopefully that should be enough protection!</p>
<p>I like to occasionally steal my wife&#8217;s laptop (please don&#8217;t tell her!), a <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/sp678">2013 Macbook Air</a>, and my mobile devices are Apple-made too: an <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-5s/specs/">iPhone 5S</a> and an <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/specs/">iPad Air</a>. You would think I&#8217;m an Apple fanboy, but I really like some Android smartphones. I would never buy any other tablet than an iPad though.</p>
<p>At home, I have a dumb Toshiba <span class="caps">LED</span> TV that is connected to a 3rd generation <a href="https://www.apple.com/appletv/">Apple TV</a> and a <a href="http://www.teac.com/product/mc-dv600/">Teac MC-DV600 receiver</a>. The Apple TV is getting dated but it&#8217;s still great for me. I use Airplay all the time to mirror content from video apps, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video feed me with more content than I can actually watch, and the Podcast and Radio apps are just great. I would probably use a <a href="http://www.raspbmc.com/">Raspberry Pi with <span class="caps">XBMC</span></a> if I was in Europe, but here there&#8217;s no need for it. The Teac receiver is not too fancy (I really need to upgrade those bookshelf speakers), but its secret weapon is a multizone <span class="caps">DVD</span> player that lets me watch movies I purchased in Spain. I also have an <a href="http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/turntables/9a7f42b88ee1e14b/index.html">Audio-Technica AT-LP60 turntable</a>, a <a href="http://www.ultimateears.com/en-us/boom">Logitech UE Boom wireless speaker</a> and I recently ordered the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-W87CUN-Fire-TV-Stick/dp/B00GDQ0RMG">Amazon Fire TV Stick</a> but I won&#8217;t get it for another two weeks.</p>
<h3>And what software?</h3>
<h4>Design</h4>
<p><a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch 3</a> has become my main design tool: I use it for wireframes and also for more polished mockups. Then I create and share clickable prototypes with <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a>, which is one of the most useful web-based tools a designer can use.</p>
<p><img src="/images/sketch3.jpg" title="Sketch 3" alt="Sketch 3" /></p>
<p>When I need to edit bitmap files I still open <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop</a>, but I&#8217;ve never been a fan. I was a <a href="https://creative.adobe.com/products/fireworks">Fireworks</a> user for a long time and when Adobe started neglecting it I switched to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Illustrator</a> which kind of worked for me (it&#8217;s still as bloated as Photoshop). Recently Sketch gained traction in the design community and I was happy to switch.</p>
<p>I also use many smaller tools like <a href="https://imageoptim.com/">ImageOptim</a> to optimize image compression, <a href="http://xscopeapp.com/">xScope</a> to measure things on screen and mirror mockups in mobile devices, <a href="http://theolabrothers.com/sip/">Sip</a> to pick colors on screen, and <a href="http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT2506">Preview</a> for almost everything else. Seriously, Preview is a powerful piece of software that is often underused.</p>
<h4>Development</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> is my default browser and when I try to switch to Safari or any other browser I always come back to Chrome because of the developer tools and plugins. <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a> is my favorite text editor and similarly, when I try any other editor I always end up back in Sublime because it&#8217;s faster and it has more and better plugins. For Git purposes I use <a href="http://www.git-tower.com/">Tower</a> and as most designers I use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(OS_X)">Terminal</a> only when it&#8217;s strictly necessary (start and stop servers, update stuff and not a lot more). <a href="http://www.binarynights.com/forklift/">Forklift</a> is my <span class="caps">FTP</span> client but I rarely use <span class="caps">FTP</span> anymore, and I use <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion">VMware Fusion</a> when I need to run Windows and check things on Internet Explorer.</p>
<h4>Productivity</h4>
<p>I use <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> like 50 times a day. It helps me save time doing custom web searches, starting local servers, checking the weather, sending todo items to Trello, expanding text&#8230; It&#8217;s similar to Quicksilver but without the learning curve. I also use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12">BetterSnapTool</a> to arrange windows in my screen and <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword">1Password</a> to save&#8230; yes, passwords. I manage my todo lists with <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>, all my emails are stored in a <a href="https://www.google.com/work/apps/business/">Google Apps</a> account and I also store things on <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> (at work) and <a href="https://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a> (for personal stuff). <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> helps me take random notes, keep snippets of code, and store screenshots of websites and things I like, but I&#8217;m looking for an alternative. Maybe I&#8217;ll give <a href="http://www.onenote.com/">OneNote</a> a try soon.</p>
<h4>Other</h4>
<p>At work we use <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> for messaging and I use <a href="http://www.skype.com/en/">Skype</a> when I need to call someone in Europe. I have a 20,000 songs collection that I keep in <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-match/">iTunes Match</a> and sometimes I listen to <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-radio/">iTunes Radio</a> because it&#8217;s included in my iTunes subscription and it doesn&#8217;t have commercials, but it&#8217;s not great. <a href="https://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> is my read-it-later thing and I check blog articles and news on <a href="http://readkitapp.com/">ReadKit</a> (mac) and <a href="http://supertop.co/unread/">Unread</a> (iPad). <a href="https://readmill.com/">Readmill</a> used to be my default ebook reader, but now that it&#8217;s closed I have to use <a href="https://www.apple.com/ibooks/">iBooks</a>.</p>
<h3>What would be your dream setup?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m happy with my current setup. As I said before, I&#8217;m waiting for the day that Apple announces new Thunderbolt Displays and Apple TVs, and I also think that I will buy a new receiver when we move to a bigger house. And about the software, I&#8217;m always trying new stuff. The goal is to try to simplify things and find smoother workflows, but that&#8217;s not always easy.</p>
