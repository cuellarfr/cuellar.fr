![firefox billboard](/images/browse_ethical.jpg)

I see this billboard on my way to work every morning and it makes me think that if there's a new browser war it's going to be about ethics, not technical specs or performance. The happy years of _don't be evil_ are far away and users stopped trusting Big Tech. This might be just the beginning.
