description: Just a small collection of templates for FigJam
---
[FigJam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/) is an online whiteboard tool made by the creators of [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). A bit more straighforward than [Miro](https://miro.com/), it's a great tool for ideating and brainstorming with your team and I've been using it a lot in the last few months. 

This is just a small collection of templates and diagrams that I created for FigJam. If you are a Figma user, please feel free to take a look and duplicate them if they work for you too.
