Grunticon makes it easy to use HD-ready (retina) vector illustrations, icons, and background images in your web project without the hassles of spotty browser compatibility. The tool processes a set of SVG files, generates PNG fallback images for legacy browsers, and exports a demo page showing how to use the final icons.
