<p>A few weeks ago I had the chance to visit <a href="http://www.travelportland.com/">Portland</a>. Lightspeed opened a new office there so it was the perfect excuse to visit another city and another state!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I have to say that I loved the place. In fact, I loved it so much that I’m considering moving there in the next months. These are some of the cool things you can find in Portland:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Plenty of music venues, concerts, bars, record stores, cultural life…</li>
  <li>The biggest book store in the world.</li>
  <li>Food carts everywhere, and all kind of food styles.</li>
  <li>Beer, beer and more beer. They say it’s the beer capital of the world… I don’t know if the germans agree, but this place is full of breweries.</li>
  <li>You can drive out of the city and find the country in 30 minutes, the coast in 90 minutes and a freakin’ volcano in 75 minutes.</li>
  <li>It’s a tech hub. Plenty of nerds around.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I had to write a list of cons, it would probably have only one item: <strong>it rains</strong>. A lot. So I might miss the sun, but I think I still want to give Portland a chance. Who knows, maybe after all these years I can find another place that I can call home.</p>
