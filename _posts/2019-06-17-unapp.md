> A directory of minimal and useful single-purpose apps.

I found some gems for macOS in this list of little apps that only do one thing, but they do it right. My favorite so far is Muzzle. If you regularly share your screen during videoconferences, [download it now!](https://muzzleapp.com/) You'll thank me later.
