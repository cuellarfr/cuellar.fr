This is an interesting project where [Marcos Rodriguez](http://marco.la/) and [ZÃ© Felipe](http://zefelipe.com/) compiled 150 album covers from last year organized by color. Every cover is linked to its album in Spotify.

I think that in this streaming era the concept of album (and cover album) is getting diluted. I hope they don't end up being just a thing of record freaks like me.
