The Friends of Rachel Worth was the second [Go-Betweens](http://go-betweens.net) album I bought back in 2000. A year before, I discovered this Australian band thanks to a compilation CD called _Bellavista Terrace_, and they immediately became one of my favorite bands ever.

Last week I was listening to this album for the first time in a long time while at work, and after doing some quick online research, I discovered it was recorded in Portland, only a few blocks away from my office, and Forster and McLennan were joined in the studio by [Sleater-Kinney](http://www.sleater-kinney.com)! Then I thought of how random it is that so many of the albums I loved in the early 2000s were produced in the Pacific Northwest and how I ended up living here almost 20 years later.
