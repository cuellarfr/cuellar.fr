<p>In the last few weeks I felt like I needed to write again and update this blog. Oh yes, I know this sounds like a cheap new year’s resolution and I know I have written these exact same words before, but this time I want to take it a bit more seriously and I have some good reasons to do it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, I want to force myself to write in English. I have lived in the US for almost three years and I speak and write in English daily, at work and at home, but it’s not the same writing a few words in a chat window than writing a full weblog post.</p>
<p>Second, I consume a pretty big amount of information daily: news, blogs about sports, technology, design, web development and other nerdy stuff. It’s probably healthy to stop reading sometimes and join the party by writing something. I don’t think a lot of people is going to read this blog and, honestly, I don’t care. This is completely selfish, just about me feeling better. But if someone stops by and wants to say hello, you are more than welcome.</p>
<p>And also, updating the design of this site has forced me to use again some old tools that I haven’t used in years. I do some front-end dev at work, but we are a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> shop so my workflow has evolved A <span class="caps">LOT</span>. Using <a href="http://textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a> again was difficult, it felt like going back in time 10 years! I didn’t feel comfortable at all, but I found this little <a href="https://github.com/whaleen/txp.foundation/blob/master/textpattern/plugins/cnk_versioning.txt">plugin</a> (a real lifesaver) that allowed me to develop using flat files, so I could at least use <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> within <span class="caps">TXP</span>. But this is probably the last time I update a Textpattern website. Don’t get me wrong, Textpattern is still a solid and flexible <span class="caps">CMS</span> that works for some people, but it just feels dated. Next time I might be migrating to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="http://getkirby.com/">Kirby</a> or something similar. Sign of the times.</p>
