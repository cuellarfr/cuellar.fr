description: I recently started using Pinterest to store screenshots of websites and user interfaces

As a digital designer I like to store screenshots of websites, apps and other user interfaces that I use later for inspiration. I've been doing this for a few years and I have changed my setup a few times.

I started using [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) to keep track of everything. Evernote was quite flexible and I liked how I could use folders and tags, and the built-in OCR was nice too, but I stopped using it because the process was just too manual and slow. I had to take a screenshot with [Paparazzi](https://derailer.org/paparazzi/), rename the file, import it in Evernote and then add all that metadata... too much work.

After that I started using [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/). The workflow was smoother because with Google Drive you can use a [Chrome extension](http://googledrive.blogspot.com/2012/12/introducing-save-to-drive-extension.html) that uploads web screenshots with just one click, so that was nice! The problem is that using Google Drive as an image viewer is not that great: you can't resize the thumbnails and the content takes forever to load. I had to find something better.

So, after trying a few [desktop apps](https://realmacsoftware.com/ember/) with little success, I decided to give [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) an opportunity. Yes, Pinterest is that social network where you go find pictures of cupcakes. But Pinterest is fast, it has a really handy Chrome extension and, if you follow the right people, it can help you find cool stuff too.

**So now [I'm on Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/uxcuellar/).** If you follow me, I'll follow you... as long as you don't pin pictures of cupcakes.
