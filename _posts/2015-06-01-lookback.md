I'm doing some usability testing at work and I just discovered that <a href="http://silverbackapp.com/">Silverback</a>, the screen capture software I used before, doesn't work anymore in my new Macbook. Looking for an alternative I found <a href="https://lookback.io/">Lookback</a>. It's simple, multi-platform (Mac, iOS and Android), and it uploads your recordings to the cloud so you can share them with the rest of your team.
